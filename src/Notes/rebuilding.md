|1.Shuaicheng build the alpha version (1-2 Months),if the page performance or style is too bad, front end developer redo the pages(2-3Months).|2.New Java Developer and Ruchang&Chunyan do it(6+ Months).|3. As same as selection 1.|4. Ruchang lead to do it.|5.Ruchang lead to do it.|
|New project will be  quick-response,it need high-quality developer(1- 2) than more guys .That will be easier to add new functions or analyse data in it . Because I have done some work for it ,it can be finished by the deadline ,and if new page style can be settled down in2 months ,there will not be big problem in it.|It is a hard plan ,but will make new art fit with the other IT projects' parttern. You should add 1 or 2 senior Java developer to start this plan. |Except data still can not be synchronized between PRO and UAT ,and we need deal with some problems when developing ,others will be as same as above 'selection 1'.|Rewrite the codes ,review the major modules and logics ,restructure some assemblies and add some notes for main parts. It is a simple plan and maybe smoothly to execute ,and can be speed up by adding more developers. Because of historical issues ,there will be some problems like contradiction between real time & performance and  slow speed to achieve new requests.|This means we will only change or add some pages to match the new requests ,and do some work at back-end and database to support changes.|
